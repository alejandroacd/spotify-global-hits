## 00's Spotify Global Hits: Save your favorites üéµ
This web app lets you explore and enjoy a public Spotify playlist featuring the top global hits from the 2000s. Built using the Spotify Web API, the app allows users to browse the playlist freely and, if they choose to connect their Spotify account, like songs to save them directly to their Liked Songs library.


## Features and key points ‚ú®

 - üîó  Spotify Integration: Connect your Spotify account, getting authenticated (using NextAuth.js in the background), to interact with the playlist. You can like it, and it will be added to your Liked Songs library. This feature includes handling tokens and automatic token refresh.

- ‚ù§Ô∏è Save Your Favorites:  Like songs, and they‚Äôll be added to your personal Liked Songs library on Spotify. It uses the Spotify Web API to make a PUT request (only if you are authenticated). It includes optimistic UI and a minimalistic notification system to create a smooth experience for the user.

- üåÄ Interactive Carousel: Navigate through the playlist smoothly with an interactive carousel for an engaging browsing experience.
